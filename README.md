### 8 minds. 1 question. Infinite consequences.

---

> Drop 8 of history's greatest minds into a room. Ask a question. Watch them collide.

Musk argues with Sartre about free will. Feynman calls bullshit on Johnson's immortality quest. Kobe tells everyone to stop philosophizing and just *do*. Carlin laughs at all of them. And you? You're the one pulling the strings.

## What is this?

A multi-agent deliberation system where 8 AI personas — built from ~3,500 tokens of researched personality data each — argue existential questions using **any free OpenAI-compatible LLM**.

No paid API keys. No cloud dependencies. Just pure intellectual chaos.

## Features

- **K-ZERO Console** — Interactive god-mode. Inject variables mid-debate. Whisper to individual agents. Watch consequences ripple through the group.
- **8 deeply researched personas** — Not "be creative" prompts. Real cognitive biases, speech patterns, memory seeds, and clash dynamics sourced from primary texts.
- **Any free LLM API** — Groq, OpenRouter, Google AI Studio. Pick one, plug it in, run.
- **Post-simulation analysis** — LLM-powered transcript analysis extracts agreement maps, position tracking, emergent insights, and topic clusters.
- **Interactive Dash dashboard** — Network graphs, conflict heatmaps, position timelines, and key quotes. All in Plotly.
- **3 pre-built scenarios** — Meaning of life, AI alignment, death and legacy. Or write your own.
- **Shareable transcripts** — Every session saves to JSON. Replay, analyze, share.

## K-ZERO Console

You are the demiurge. The council exists because you willed it.

```
K-ZERO > /all What is worth dying for?
```

Watch 8 agents respond in character, building on each other's arguments.

```
K-ZERO > /inject BREAKING: A message from the future confirms no one 
         will remember any of you in 200 years.
```

Watch the shockwave. Musk doubles down. Sartre shrugs. Kobe doesn't care. Carlin saw it coming.

```
K-ZERO > /ask feynman Does Bryan's immortality quest contradict everything 
         you believe about curiosity?
```

Pull one thread. Watch the whole tapestry shift.

### All Commands

| Command | What it does |
|---------|-------------|
| `/all <question>` | Pose a question — all 8 agents respond |
| `/ask <name> <text>` | Whisper to one agent directly |
| `/inject <text>` | God-mode variable injection — mid-debate plot twist |
| `/next` | Let the next round play out naturally |
| `/next <N>` | Run N rounds without intervention |
| `/who` | Show all members and their current stance |
| `/history` | Show recent transcript |
| `/synthesis` | Kevin synthesizes the discussion so far |
| `/end` | End session and save transcript |

---

## Visualization

After a simulation, run the analyzer and dashboard:

```bash
# Analyze the transcript
python -m runner.analyze transcripts/meaning_of_life_20260402.json

# Launch the interactive Dash dashboard
python -m runner.visualize analysis_result.json
```

The dashboard shows:

- **Network graph** — Who agrees with whom, weighted by interaction strength
- **Conflict heatmap** — Pairwise agreement/disagreement intensity
- **Position timeline** — How each agent's stance evolves across rounds
- **Key quotes** — Most impactful moments, auto-extracted
- **Emergent insights** — Ideas that no individual agent proposed, but the group produced

## How It Works

```
Character Data ──→ System Prompt ──→ LLM Call ──→ Transcript
     │                                              │
  voice.md                                    saved as JSON
  axioms.md                                         │
  clash_points.md                                   ▼
  memory_seeds.md                  Analyzer (LLM-powered) ──→ Dash Dashboard
  personality_matrix.json            agreement maps             network graph
                                     position tracking          heatmap
                                     emergent insights          timeline
```

Each agent's system prompt is assembled from ~3,500 tokens of character data: speech patterns, core beliefs, interaction dynamics, and formative memories. The LLM doesn't improvise a personality — it inhabits one.

## Scenarios

| # | Scenario | The Question | Spiciest Tension |
|---|----------|-------------|-----------------|
| 1 | **Meaning of Life** | What is the point of life? | Musk (extend consciousness) vs Carlin (failed experiment) |
| 2 | **AI Alignment** | Should we build god? | Musk (build it) vs Sartre (existential threat to freedom) |
| 3 | **Death and Legacy** | What survives us? | Johnson (don't die) vs Kobe (legacy through craft) |

Want a custom scenario? Create a JSON file:

```json
{
  "id": "your_scenario",
  "title": "Your Question",
  "opening_prompt": "The council is gathered to deliberate on...",
  "moderator_prompts": ["Kevin asks: ..."],
  "god_mode_injection": {
    "mid_discussion": "BREAKING: ...",
    "late_discussion": "BREAKING: ..."
  }
}
```

## Add Your Own Council

Each character is a folder under `characters/` with 5 files:

1. **`personality_matrix.json`** — Cognitive biases, knowledge domains, interaction weights
2. **`voice.md`** — How they talk. Sentence structure, vocabulary, verbal tics
3. **`axioms.md`** — 10 non-negotiable beliefs
4. **`clash_points.md`** — How they react to every other member
5. **`memory_seeds.md`** — Formative experiences the LLM can reference

Use primary sources. Biographies, interviews, their own writing. The richer the data, the more the agent sounds like *them* instead of a chatbot cosplaying.
